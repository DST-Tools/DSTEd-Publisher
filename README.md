# DSTEd-Publisher
Publisher for Steam-Workshop

What can it do
1. Upload mod by Command `Upload`. For a sample,   
  your mod content in `./mod/`, preview image file is `./a.gif`, and you want `"My mod"` title, you can type these in shell.   
  `./Publisher --upload "./mod/" "./a.gif" "My mod"`

2. List your published mod by `List` command, just type `./publisher --list`

3. Download mod without subcribing it. `./publisher download MOD_ID`

TODOs:
1. Better intergration with [DSTED-C](https://github.com/DST-Tools/DSTEd-C)
  - Upload a mod with more detailed information.
